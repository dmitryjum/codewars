## About Codewars
Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

## About this repository
I use Codewars to practice languages, algorithms, stay current with logical thinking, improve the knowledge of specific programming language and learn something new. I'm storing my solutions to problems that I've solved in this repository.
